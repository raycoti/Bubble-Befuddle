## Gameplay 
 Players pick between purple and blue teams and must pop bubbles according to their team color, any bubble that hits a wall will result in their teams water level rising. Popping certain amounts of bubbles will result in gaining power-ups such as a puffer fish that you can fling at your opponents bubbles to make their water level rise faster or a sponge you can drag that lowers the water level of the bubbleâ€™s corresponding color.  Being up close to the screen added the challenge of limited scope which heightens the intensity, physical strategies exist as well as players are moving around each other and could box each other out
